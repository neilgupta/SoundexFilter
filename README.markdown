SoundexFilter
=============

A Soundex algorithm implementation for Lucene, tested with Lucene 3.0.3.

SoundexFilter converts English tokens into Soundex tokens, while SoundexAnalyzer is identical to Lucene's StandardAnalyzer, except it also runs tokens through my SoundexFilter.

This filter was created for a larger assignment for my CS 429 Information Retrieval class.
